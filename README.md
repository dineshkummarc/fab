NOTE: This branch is no longer maintained. All subsequent development will focus on [the next version of (fab)](http://github.com/jed/fab/tree/v3).

(fab) is a lightweight (~2KB minified and gzipped) toolkit that makes it easy to build asynchronous web apps. It takes advantage of the flexibility of javascript to create a concise DSL without pre-compilation or magic scope hackery.
